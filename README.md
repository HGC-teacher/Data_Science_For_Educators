# Data_Science_For_Educators
This Data Science Tutorial was authored as a group project within the Master of Learning Sciences and Technology degree at The University of Sydney in 2022. The tutorial uses the 4C/ID-model (van MerriÃ«nboer, Jelsma, & Paas, 1992) designed for coordinating and integrating complex skills in training programs. Using this framework, this online tutorial for beginner level educational data science has been developed to teach explorative data analysis and visualisation of typical course and classroom data. It is intended for educators whose role includes working with data such as school leaders, head teachers and instructional designers involved in evaluation and re-redesign. The tutorial uses an agile, data-driven approach with rapid prototyping, refined over 4 iterations in response to insights gained through peer-user testing.
